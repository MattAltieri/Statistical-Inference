Consider influenza epidemics for two parent heterosexual families. Suppose that the probability is 15% that at least one of the parents has contracted the disease. The probability that the father has contracted influenza is 10% while that the mother contracted the disease is 9%. What is the probability that both contract influenza expressed as a whole number percentage?

- 15%?
- 10%?
- 9%?
- 4%?

$$
\begin{eqnarray*}
P(F) = 0.10 \\
P(M) = 0.09 \\
P(F \cup M) = 0.15 \\
P(F \cap M) = ? \\ \\
P(F \cup M) = P(F) + P(M) + P(F \cap M) \\
0.15 = 0.10 + 0.09 - P(F \cap M) \\
0.15 = 0.19 - P(F \cap M) \\
0.15 - 0.19 = -P(F \cap M) \\
-0.04 = -P(F \cap M) \\
0.04 = P(F \cap M)
\end{eqnarray*}
